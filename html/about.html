                    Welcome! I'm Matthew, and I'm so glad you're here.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Photography has always been a hobby of mine. But as I 
                    grew older, I realized the lasting impact it can have on 
                    people. Being able to look back on a special time in your 
                    life is something that canâ€™t be measured. It's this exact 
                    reason I decided to use my hobby to help bring joy to others 
                    by photographing the most important moments of their lives.

                    In addition to dabbling in photography, I am also a computer 
                    science major. When I'm not out taking photos of the world, 
                    I'm designing new applications or websites to showcase my work.
